Project 3 step-by-step plan:

Step 1:
    I will create my main menu loop.
Step 2:
    Will create a basic if case for each of the 4 main options. I'll put a random print statement
    in each to make sure they work properly
Step 3:
    Create a global variable for the balance amount. Then create an f-string in option 1 to show a message
    for amount in the balance including a dollar sign.
Step 4:
    Prompt the user for money to put into the total balance variable in option 2. Add that amount to the total balance.
Step 5:
    In option 3, I'll prompt the user to take money out of their total. If they try taking more than they have, I'll
    give an error message by using if/else statements
Step 6:
    Create a global variable to prompt for the user account and pin number. Replace instances of "you" and "your" in my
    messages to output the username given.
Step 7:
    Create a global variable prompt for the user PIN. Create an if check in the withdraw section to see if
    they are allowed to withdraw from this account.
Step 8:
    TEST TEST TEST. Test everything all together and make sure nothing has any holes. Add small tweaks where
    I might want something to look more polished.
